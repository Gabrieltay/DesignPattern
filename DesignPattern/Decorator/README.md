# Decorator
======

**Use the Decorator pattern**
 ..* Attach additional state or behavior to an object dynamically
 ..* Make changes to objects in a class without affecting others
 ..* Avoid subclassing because too many could result
 ..* Existing class that may be unavailable for subclassing


 **Examples of Decorator**
 ..* Photo Object with multiple overlays (eg. Frame, Annotation)
